# blockchain-fundamentals-project

For my project I will try to build a working simulation of a 51% attack on a bridge. That is all the details that I know for now.

## 12.12.2022
I am currently figuring out what a bridge is on blockchain. First I need to figure out what is the use of bridges on the blockchain. Also I need to figure out how can I attack a bridge and make a 51% attack on it. Currently I don't know the exact resources needed for completing this project.

So for this week, I will delve deeper into the mechanics behind bridges. I am reading these articles for know, and when I finish I will post a summary.
