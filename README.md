# blockchain-fundamentals-project

For my project I will try to build a working simulation of a 51% attack on a bridge. That is all the details that I know for now.

## 12.12.2022
I am currently figuring out what a bridge is on blockchain. First I need to figure out what is the use of bridges on the blockchain. Also I need to figure out how can I attack a bridge and make a 51% attack on it. Currently I don't know the exact resources needed for completing this project.

So for this week, I will delve deeper into the mechanics behind bridges. I am reading these articles for know, and when I finish I will post a summary.

### Summary of research on bridges
Blockchain bridges are a type of technology that allows two different blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data or value. They can be used to link two independent blockchains, or to connect a main blockchain to a sidechain.

There are several types of blockchain bridges, including:

- Cross-chain bridges: These bridges allow two different blockchain networks to exchange data or value directly.

- Interledger bridges: These bridges allow different blockchain networks to communicate with each other via an intermediate layer, such as the Interledger Protocol (ILP).

- State channels: These bridges allow two parties to perform transactions off-chain, reducing the burden on the main blockchain and improving scalability.

Blockchain bridges have a number of potential uses, including:

- Enabling cross-chain interoperability
- Enabling cross-chain transactions
- Allowing for the creation of sidechains
- Facilitating the exchange of assets between different blockchain networks
- Enabling the use of different blockchain protocols in a single application

As for the general steps in creating a 51% attack on a private network, this is the steps that I could think of so far. Keep in mind these may not be 100% correct, but I think I am on the right track:
1. Set up a private Ethereum network. This network also must include a private Ethereum bridge. 
2. Building and implementing the private Ethereum bridge. This bridge will need to implement my private network to another network.
3. Abuse the flawed bridge

After doing more research, I realized that maybe building my own blockchain and simulating a 51% attack is easier than building my own bridge. I am now in the process of finding all documenatiation possible on creating my blockchain, and then I will learn more about creating a 51% attack on it.

I am also looking into forking my blockchain from Ethereum to see what is more suitable for this project.

These are the resources I found so far:
